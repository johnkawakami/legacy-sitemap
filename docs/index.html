    <h1>Legacy Article Review Tool and Sitemap Generator</h1>

    <p>This is a tool to help  you migrate a static, HTML file 
        website into
        a CMS, without importing everything. You can re-read
        each article to determine if it's worth importing.
    </p>
    <p>It's designed to work with HTML Importer 2, for WordPress, but
        can work with other software.</p>

    <p>It also helps you stay
        in the search engines, by producing a sitemap
        linking to all your legacy content.</p>

    <p>After importation, the tool helps create mod_rewrite 
        RewriteRules and inserts them into an .htaccess file,
        so the old URLs redirect to the new URLs.</p>
